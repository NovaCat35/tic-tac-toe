# Tic-Tac-Toe
Took me some time to finally understand the minMax algo and making it work with the changes I had üòÖ. Glad it's finally over and happy to share this so other can try it out too. You can play with other players or challenge yourself against the impossible bot. Now, get ready to duel in the classic game of tic-tac-toe!!
